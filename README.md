# tasty
a simple task manager

## What to do?

This project is a very simple terminal based, personal task manager.

Your goal is to write the python code in the class to make it work.

Once finished, I'll give you a solution written by someone else, and you'll compare an docntrast the way you did it with another.

## How does it work?
TASTY is very easy to use. Here's the full list of commands, which you can also find directly by using it.


## Two problems

- How to represent a task within the class
- How to save/load tasks

_Look at the last two lines of Tasty.py, what is happening there?_

### Phase 1 Get these commands working...

`help`: display a help message

`exit`: exit Tasty

`clear`: clear the screen


### Phase 2 and now these

`new <task name>`: create a new task

`tasks`: display all the tasks

### Phase 3 make task persistant and change state

`save`: save your tasks, the trash and your advancement

`load`: load the save file (saved_tasks.json)

`complete <task name>`: complete a task

`unfinish <task name>`: mark a task as unfinished

### Phase 4 finish with these

`remove <task name>`: move a task in the trash

`destroy <task name>`: remove a task from the trash (removed definetely)

`trash`: display the content of the trash

`advancements`: display the amount of completed and unfinished tasks
